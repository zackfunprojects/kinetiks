# Product Video Mode

Transform static product images into cinematic video content. This mode handles product reveals, animated hero shots, 360 showcases, and e-commerce video — all the video types that make products feel premium and desirable.

**Loaded by:** `creative/SKILL.md` when user selects mode 2 (Product Video).
**Model selection:** Handled by `references/MODEL_REGISTRY.md` — never hardcode model IDs in prompts or workflows.
**Brand consistency:** Reads from `./brand/creative-kit.md` before every generation.
**File output:** All deliverables saved to `./campaigns/{product}/video/`

---

## Why This Mode Exists

**The problem:** Video content converts dramatically better than static images, but:
1. Traditional product video requires expensive shoots
2. Most AI video prompts produce generic, floaty results
3. Different platforms need different video styles
4. Wrong motion can cheapen even premium products
5. Each video model has a different API interface, making multi-model comparison error-prone
6. No single model wins every prompt — quality depends on the specific content

**The solution:** A systematic approach that:
- Uses proven commercial motion styles
- Matches motion to product category and positioning
- Leverages multi-model generation for quality selection
- Anchors animation to approved static images (I2V workflow)
- References MODEL_REGISTRY.md for all API payloads (never hardcodes model names)
- Runs parallel multi-model generation and lets the user pick the winner
- Plans multi-clip sequences that edit together into longer pieces
- Tracks estimated generation cost per model before execution

---

## Model Selection

**Do NOT hardcode model IDs.** Always refer to `references/MODEL_REGISTRY.md` for the current default video model and its verified API payload.

As of this writing, the three video models available are:

| Role | Model | Registry Section | Estimated Cost (5s clip) |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Default** | Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro | Video Generation > Default Model | ~$0.40 |
| **Comparison** | Google Veo 3.1 | Video Generation > Comparison Model: Google Veo 3.1 | ~$0.80-1.50 |
| **Comparison** | OpenAI Sora 2 | Video Generation > Comparison Model: OpenAI Sora 2 | ~$0.60-1.20 |

### How to Call

1. Open `references/MODEL_REGISTRY.md`
2. Find the **Video Generation** section
3. Copy the verified payload structure for the desired model
4. Insert your constructed motion prompt, source image, and aspect ratio
5. Execute the API call via Replicate
6. For hero content: run all three models in parallel (see Parallel Multi-Model Generation below)

### Cross-Model Parameter Cheat Sheet

Every video model uses different parameter names for the same concept. Always consult MODEL_REGISTRY.md before writing any API call.

| Concept | Kling 2.5 | Veo 3.1 | Sora 2 |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Starting image** | `start_image` | `image` | `input_reference` |
| **Duration** | `duration` (5, 10) | `duration` (4, 6, 8) | `seconds` (4-12) |
| **Aspect ratio** | `aspect_ratio` ("16:9") | `aspect_ratio` ("16:9") | `aspect_ratio` ("landscape") |
| **Prompt adherence** | *(removed)* | — | — |
| **Negative prompt** | `negative_prompt` | `negative_prompt` | — |
| **Audio generation** | Not native | `generate_audio` | Native (always on) |
| **Ending frame** | `end_image` | `last_frame` | — |
| **Resolution control** | Fixed 1080p | `resolution` ("720p", "1080p") | Fixed |
| **Reproducibility** | — | `seed` | — |

### Model Strengths and Weaknesses

Refer to MODEL_REGISTRY.md for authoritative details. Summary for prompt-routing decisions:

**Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro (Default):**
- Best motion control, cinematic depth, consistent quality
- Strong prompt adherence
- Best for human subjects and natural motion
- Longer video coherence (5s and 10s)
- Sometimes adds unwanted elements
- Fast camera movements can cause warping at edges

**Google Veo 3.1:**
- Highest fidelity video output
- Can generate matching audio (set `generate_audio: true`)
- Cinematic quality
- Slower generation, higher cost
- Sometimes "interprets" prompts loosely
- No square aspect ratio support

**OpenAI Sora 2:**
- Strong prompt comprehension
- Good motion coherence
- Native audio generation (always on)
- Most variable generation times
- Sometimes over-stylizes
- No square aspect ratio support

### When to Use Which

```
GENERAL PRODUCT → Kling 2.5 (reliable, fast, cheapest)
NEEDS AUDIO → Veo 3.1 (native audio, highest fidelity)
HAS PEOPLE → Kling 2.5 (best human motion)
HERO/FLAGSHIP → Run all 3 in parallel, pick winner
UNCERTAIN → Run all 3 in parallel, pick winner
```

---

## Parallel Multi-Model Generation

For hero content and any case where quality matters more than cost, run the same motion prompt through all three video models simultaneously.

### Why Parallel Beats Sequential

- No single model wins every prompt — the best output varies by content
- Running in parallel takes the same wall-clock time as the slowest model (~6 min)
- Running sequentially would take ~15 minutes for all three
- Total cost for a parallel comparison run: ~$2.20 (see Cost Awareness below)
- Eliminates guessing — present all three, let the user pick

### Parallel Execution Pattern

Use task agents to fire all three API calls simultaneously:

```
PARALLEL GENERATION PLAN
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Task 1: Kling 2.5     → cost ~$0.40, time ~3min
Task 2: Veo 3.1       → cost ~$1.00, time ~5min
Task 3: Sora 2        → cost ~$0.80, time ~6min
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                   ~$2.20, ~6min (parallel)
```

**Steps:**
1. Construct the motion prompt (shared across all models)
2. Translate the prompt into each model's API format (check MODEL_REGISTRY.md for parameter names)
3. Launch all three API calls in parallel
4. Poll for completion (all should finish within ~6 minutes)
5. Present all three outputs side-by-side for user selection

### Translating One Prompt to Three APIs

Given a motion prompt and source image, the payload differs per model. Example for a 16:9 I2V call:

**Kling 2.5 payload (from MODEL_REGISTRY.md):**
```json
{
  "model": "kwaivgi/kling-v2.5-turbo-pro",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "{{motion_prompt}}",
    "start_image": "{{source_image_url}}",
    "duration": 5,
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
  }
}
```

**Veo 3.1 payload (from MODEL_REGISTRY.md):**
```json
{
  "model": "google/veo-3.1",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "{{motion_prompt}}",
    "image": "{{source_image_url}}",
    "duration": 8,
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "resolution": "1080p",
    "generate_audio": true
  }
}
```

**Sora 2 payload (from MODEL_REGISTRY.md):**
```json
{
  "model": "openai/sora-2",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "{{motion_prompt}}",
    "input_reference": "{{source_image_url}}",
    "seconds": 8,
    "aspect_ratio": "landscape"
  }
}
```

**Critical:** Always verify these payloads against MODEL_REGISTRY.md before execution. Parameter names change when models update.

## I2V vs T2V: Why Image-First Wins

### Image-to-Video (I2V) — RECOMMENDED

```
product-photo mode → [approve image] → product-video mode (I2V)
```

**Why I2V is superior for products:**
- Frame 1 is exactly what you approved
- Product appearance locked in
- Motion anchored to known composition
- Easy iteration without changing product
- If video fails, you still have the approved image

### Text-to-Video (T2V)

Only use when:
- No source image available
- Need completely new composition
- Exploring motion concepts before committing to image

T2V requires extremely detailed prompts and often needs multiple attempts.

---

## Motion Style Exploration

**Don't lock into one motion style.** Generate multiple approaches, pick the winner.

### Why Motion Style Matters

The same product animated differently can feel:
- Premium vs cheap
- Innovative vs traditional
- Exciting vs calming
- Professional vs amateur

**One style = hope. Multiple styles = informed choice.**

### 5 Motion Style Directions

dreamlike quality, premium tech aesthetic

Style 4 - Dynamic Energy (Bold):
Fast camera moves, dramatic angles, high energy,
sports/action commercial aesthetic

Style 5 - Contextual/Lifestyle:
Product in use or setting, natural motion,
lifestyle commercial, relatable context
```

### Style Decision Framework

| Product Positioning | Best Motion Style |

## Audio Layer Guidance

Video content often needs audio. There are three distinct approaches, and the right one depends on content type and destination platform.

### Approach 1: Model-Native Audio

Some video models generate synchronized audio as part of the video output. This is the fastest path to audio-inclusive video.

**Veo 3.1 (native audio via `generate_audio: true`):**
- Generates contextually aware audio matched to visual content
- Best for ambient sounds, environmental audio, product sounds
- Adds processing time (~30-60s extra)
- Quality is good for ambient/environmental, weaker for speech
- Set `generate_audio: true` in the API payload (see MODEL_REGISTRY.md)

**Sora 2 (audio always on):**
- Always generates audio alongside video
- Cannot be disabled
- Audio quality varies — sometimes excellent, sometimes distracting
- Review audio carefully; you may want to strip it in post

**Kling 2.5 (no native audio):**
- Does not generate audio
- Output is silent video
- Add audio in post-production if needed

### Approach 2: Voiceover via TTS

For narrated product videos, generate the video silently and add voiceover separately.

**Workflow:**
```
1. Generate product video (any model, audio off or stripped)
2. Write voiceover script
3. Generate voiceover audio via TTS service (ElevenLabs, etc.)
4. Combine video + voiceover in post
```

**When to use TTS voiceover:**
- Product explanation or feature walkthrough
- Brand voice consistency required
- Multiple language versions needed
- Testimonial-style narration

**Voiceover script tips for product video:**
- Keep it short: 5-second video = 10-15 words maximum
- Lead with benefit, not feature
- Match energy to motion style (slow reveal = calm voice, dynamic = energetic)
- Leave breathing room — silence between phrases is powerful

### Approach 3: Intentional Silence

Sometimes the best audio is no audio. Many platforms auto-mute video in feeds.

**When silence is the right choice:**
- Social feed content (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn auto-mute)
- Video will have music added in post-production
- Clean asset for editor to work with
- Product speaks for itself visually
- Platform relies on captions, not audio

### Audio Decision Matrix

| Content Type | Platform | Recommended Audio Approach |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------|
| Premium reveal | Website hero | Model-native ambient (Veo 3.1) |
| Tech product | Product page | Silence or subtle ambient |
| Lifestyle context | Instagram feed | Silence (auto-muted) |
| Feature walkthrough | YouTube | TTS voiceover |
| Food/beverage | TikTok | Model-native (sizzle, pour sounds) |
| Fashion | Instagram Reels | Silence (music added in post) |
| Testimonial | Landing page | TTS voiceover or recorded audio |
| E-commerce listing | Amazon/Shopify | Silence |

### Audio Prompt Additions (Veo 3.1)

When using Veo 3.1 with `generate_audio: true`, append audio direction to your motion prompt:

```
With accompanying audio:
+ subtle cinematic bass swell on reveal
+ ambient room tone with product sounds
+ gentle electronic undertone
+ natural environmental audio
```

### When to Skip Audio

- Will add music in post
- Platform auto-mutes
- Need flexibility for voiceover
- Clean audio for other edit
- Budget-conscious (audio adds generation time and cost)

---

## Clip Stitching: Multi-Clip Sequences

Single 5-second clips are the atomic unit of AI video. For longer content, plan multiple clips that edit together into a cohesive sequence.

### Why Clip Stitching

AI video models produce their best output in short durations (5-8 seconds). Longer generations (10s+) often have quality dips in the middle. Instead of fighting this limitation, embrace it:

- Plan a sequence of 4-6 short clips
- Each clip has a distinct camera angle, motion style, or perspective
- Together they tell a visual story
- This matches how real commercials are shot and edited

### Sequence Planning Template

Before generating any clips, plan the full sequence:

```
CLIP SEQUENCE PLAN
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Product: [product name]
Total duration: [target seconds]
Clips: [number]
Edit style: [cut/dissolve/matched]

Clip 1 (0:00-0:05): [description]
  Motion: [style]
  Camera: [movement]
  Purpose: [establish/reveal/detail/context/close]

Clip 2 (0:05-0:10): [description]
  Motion: [style]
  Camera: [movement]
  Purpose: [establish/reveal/detail/context/close]

Clip 3 (0:10-0:15): [description]
  Motion: [style]
  Camera: [movement]
  Purpose: [establish/reveal/detail/context/close]

Clip 4 (0:15-0:20): [description]
  Motion: [style]
  Camera: [movement]
  Purpose: [establish/reveal/detail/context/close]
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Estimated cost: [clips x per-clip cost]
Estimated time: [max clip time if parallel]
```

### Common Sequence Structures

**The Classic Product Reveal (4 clips, 20 seconds):**
```
Clip 1: Wide establishing shot, product in darkness, slow reveal
Clip 2: Medium orbit, product rotating to show key features
Clip 3: Close-up detail, texture/material quality visible
Clip 4: Hero shot, full product, tagline moment
```

**The Lifestyle Story (4 clips, 20 seconds):**
```
Clip 1: Context setting, environment without product
Clip 2: Product introduction, enters the scene
Clip 3: Product in use, interaction moment
Clip 4: Product hero shot, aspirational framing
```

**The Feature Walkthrough (5 clips, 25 seconds):**
```
Clip 1: Full product hero shot, establishing
Clip 2: Feature 1 detail, camera focuses on specific area
Clip 3: Feature 2 detail, different angle
Clip 4: Feature 3 detail, close-up
Clip 5: Pull back to full product, closing hero shot
```

**The Quick Social Cut (3 clips, 15 seconds):**
```
Clip 1: Attention-grabbing dynamic reveal
Clip 2: Product detail or use moment
Clip 3: Clean product shot with space for text overlay
```

### Stitching Tips

1. **Maintain consistent lighting** across clips by using similar prompt language for lighting in each clip
2. **Use the same source image** as the starting point for all clips (I2V) to maintain product consistency
3. **Vary camera angle and distance** between clips — this is what makes edits feel professional
4. **Plan transition moments** — end each clip in a state that cuts naturally to the next
5. **Generate all clips for a sequence in parallel** to save time
6. **Use end_image/last_frame** parameters (Kling and Veo) to control clip endpoints for smoother transitions
7. **Cost multiplies linearly** — a 4-clip sequence costs 4x a single clip

### Stitching Cost Estimate

| Sequence Length | Clips | Model | Estimated Cost | Estimated Time |
|----------------|-------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 15 seconds | 3 clips | Kling 2.5 | ~$1.20 | ~5min parallel |
| 20 seconds | 4 clips | Kling 2.5 | ~$1.60 | ~5min parallel |
| 20 seconds | 4 clips | All 3 models | ~$8.80 | ~6min parallel |
| 25 seconds | 5 clips | Kling 2.5 | ~$2.00 | ~5min parallel |
| 30 seconds | 6 clips | Kling 2.5 | ~$2.40 | ~5min parallel |

## Sound Design Considerations

### When to Use Audio

Consider these recommendations based on content type:

| Content Type | Audio Recommendation |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Premium reveal | Subtle ambient + bass swell |
| Tech product | Electronic tones, clean |
| Lifestyle | Environmental sounds |
| Food | Sizzle, pour, crunch |
| Fashion | Music-driven |

### Audio in Multi-Clip Sequences

When stitching clips into a sequence, audio strategy needs to be consistent across all clips:

**Option A: Generate audio per-clip (Veo 3.1)**
- Each clip gets its own audio
- May need post-production to smooth audio transitions between clips
- Best for environmental/ambient audio that can overlap

**Option B: Silent clips + post-production audio**
- Generate all clips silently
- Add music track, voiceover, or sound design in post
- Most professional approach for polished content
- Recommended for sequences longer than 10 seconds

**Option C: Audio on hero clip only**
- Generate the key clip with audio (Veo 3.1)
- Generate supporting clips silently
- Use the audio clip as the anchor, extend audio in post

[ ] Orbit Showcase (360)
[ ] Floating Premium (Tech)
[ ] Dynamic Energy (Bold)
[ ] Contextual/Lifestyle
[ ] Explore multiple (generate 2-3 approaches)
```

### Step 3: Construct Motion Prompt

Formula:
```
[Motion style template] + [Product-specific additions] +
[Category modifications] + [Duration] + [Quality terms]
```

**For I2V prompts:** Describe the MOTION, not the static scene. The model can see the starting image. Saying "camera slowly orbits right, product rotates to reveal label" is correct. Saying "a bottle of wine on a table" is wrong.

### Step 4: Estimate Cost and Confirm

Before generating, present the cost estimate:

```
GENERATION PLAN
─────────────────────────
Model(s): [list]
Clips: [number]
Duration: [seconds per clip]
Estimated cost: ~$X.XX
Estimated time: ~Xmin

Proceed? [Y/n]
```

### Step 5: Multi-Model Generation

For hero content, run the same prompt through all three models in parallel. For standard content, use the default model (Kling 2.5).

**Kling 2.5 (from MODEL_REGISTRY.md):**
```json
{
  "model": "kwaivgi/kling-v2.5-turbo-pro",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "[motion prompt]",
    "start_image": "[source image URL]",
    "duration": 5,
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
  }
}
```

**Veo 3.1 (from MODEL_REGISTRY.md):**
```json
{
  "model": "google/veo-3.1",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "[motion prompt]",
    "image": "[source image URL]",
    "duration": 8,
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "resolution": "1080p",
    "generate_audio": true
  }
}
```

**Sora 2 (from MODEL_REGISTRY.md):**
```json
{
  "model": "openai/sora-2",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "[motion prompt]",
    "input_reference": "[source image URL]",
    "seconds": 8,
    "aspect_ratio": "landscape"
  }
}
```

**Run in parallel.** Poll for completion (~2-6 minutes depending on model).

**Critical reminder:** Always verify payload structure against MODEL_REGISTRY.md before execution. Parameter names differ across models and may change when models update.

### Step 6: Present Options

```markdown
## Product Video Options Generated

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Product morphs/changes | Model interpretation | Simpler motion prompt, use I2V |
| Motion too fast | Prompt too energetic | Add "slow," "elegant," "smooth" |
| Motion too slow | Over-specified slowness | Adjust speed terms |
| Wrong elements appear | Model hallucination | Simpler prompt, different model |
| Reflections wrong | Uncontrolled light | Add "controlled reflections" |
| Looks cheap | Wrong motion style | Match style to positioning |
| Doesn't loop | Not specified | Add "seamless loop" to prompt |
| Wrong aspect | Default used | Specify ratio in API call (check MODEL_REGISTRY.md for parameter name) |
| No audio (Veo) | Not enabled | Set `generate_audio: true` |
| Background changes | Unstable composition | Use cleaner source image |
| API parameter error | Wrong param name for model | Check cross-model cheat sheet in MODEL_REGISTRY.md |
| Aspect ratio rejected | Model doesn't support it | Check MODEL_REGISTRY.md — Veo/Sora have no square support |
| Generation timeout | Model overloaded | Retry; allow extra buffer for Sora 2 |
| Quality dip mid-video | 10s generation issue | Use 5s clips and stitch instead |

## Iteration Strategies

### When Motion Is Close But Not Right

**Problem:** Almost there but something's off
**Strategy:** Targeted prompt adjustments

```
Too fast → add "slow," "elegant," "deliberate"
Too static → add "dynamic," "moving," "shifting"
Too chaotic → add "smooth," "controlled," "stable"
Wrong mood → adjust atmosphere terms
```

### When Motion Is Completely Wrong

**Problem:** Output doesn't match intent
**Strategy:** Different approach entirely

Don't iterate on broken foundation:
1. Try different motion style
2. Try different model
3. Simplify prompt dramatically
4. Check source image quality

### When Technical Issues Occur

**Problem:** Artifacts, morphing, glitches
**Strategy:** Technical fixes

```
- Use cleaner source image
- Simpler motion request
- Different model
- Lower complexity prompt
- For Kling: reduce camera speed to avoid edge warping
- For Veo: check portrait aspect ratio for unexpected cropping
- For Sora: ensure reference image matches aspect ratio
```

### When Budget Is a Concern

**Problem:** Need to minimize generation costs
**Strategy:** Targeted model selection

```
- Use Kling 2.5 only (cheapest at ~$0.40/clip)
- Skip parallel comparison
- Get motion style right with one model before comparing
- Use 5s clips, not 10s
- Plan sequences carefully before generating (avoid wasted clips)
```

## Pro Tips

### What Makes Product Video Work

1. **Motion matches positioning** — Premium products need premium motion
2. **Less is often more** — Subtle motion > chaotic movement
3. **First frame matters** — Thumbnail is first impression
4. **Consistency throughout** — Product should be recognizable entire duration
5. **Purpose-driven motion** — Every movement should have reason

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-animated** — Too much motion cheapens products
2. **Wrong speed** — Fast motion for luxury = mistake
3. **Generic prompts** — "Product reveal" is too vague
4. **Ignoring source** — Bad source image = bad video
5. **Single model reliance** — Different models excel differently
6. **Hardcoding model IDs** — Always use MODEL_REGISTRY.md
7. **Wrong parameter names** — Each model uses different names for the same concept
8. **Skipping cost estimate** — Always tell the user what it will cost before generating
9. **Generating 10s when 5s will do** — Longer is not better; shorter clips stitch better

### The 80/20 of Product Video

80% of results come from:
1. Quality source image (I2V workflow)
2. Appropriate motion style for product
3. Speed matching product positioning
4. Clean, simple motion prompts

Get these four right and you'll outperform most AI product videos.

### Multi-Model Strategy

When to invest in parallel comparison:
- **Hero content** (website banners, launch videos) — Always run all three
- **Social content** (feed posts, stories) — Default model is fine
- **Product pages** (e-commerce listings) — Default model, maybe two for key products
- **Ad creative** (paid campaigns) — Run all three, A/B test the winners

### Budget Management

```
BUDGET TIERS
─────────────────────────────────
Lean:     1 model, 1 style         ~$0.40
Standard: 1 model, 3 styles        ~$1.20
Premium:  3 models, 1 style        ~$2.20
Hero:     3 models, 3 styles       ~$6.60
Campaign: 3 models, 3 styles, stitch ~$10+
```
